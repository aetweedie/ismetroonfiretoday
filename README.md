__WMATA â€” please prioritize Metrorail safety.__

The purpose of this website is not to trivialize but to socialize the dangerous and seemingly increasingly frequent [safety issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidents_on_the_Washington_Metro) related to the public Metrorail transit service in Washington, D.C.
